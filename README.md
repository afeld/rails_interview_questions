# Rails Interview Questions

I get a fair number of questions via [Hacker Hours](http://hackerhours.org) and elsewhere regarding what questions to use/expect in an interview for a Rails developer, so figured I would get it together in a tidy list.  Pull requests welcome.

## Tips

### Interviewers

* Personalize your list of questions.
* Don't ask questions you don't know the answers to.
* Mix trivia questions with open-ended ones.

### Interviewees

* Don't study to the test.  Not all of these questions will be used, and others will be asked that aren't covered here.  Know your stuff.
* Rails skills != CS skills
* Know whether you are interviewing for a full-stack vs. backend-focused position.
* Have code up on Github/Bitbucket/wherever - the more side projects you have to talk about, the better.

## The Questions

### General

* What is a tree?  What is a DAG?
* Pseudo-code depth-first and breadth-first search.
* Given a sorted array, what is the fastest way to find a element?  What is the Big-O time to do so?

### Ruby

* What is the difference between a lambda, a block and a proc? [I have gotten this one at every Ruby interview I've been in]
* How do you sort an Array of objects by a particular attribute?  What is a better way to do sorting with ActiveRecord?
* What are some of your favorite gems?  What are their alternatives?
* In Ruby, which is generally the better option: a recursive function or an iterative one?
* What are `#method_missing` and `#send`?  Why are they useful?

### Rails

* What is the general history of Rails?
* Explain the different pieces of Rails.
* Walk through the flow of a request through Rails.
* What are the different server options for running a Rails/Rack app?
* Explain CSRF and how Rails combats it.
* Explain mass-assignment vulnerability.
